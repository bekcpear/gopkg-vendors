# `postgrestest` Contributor's Guide

`postgrestest` is intentionally a very small package, so in general I will not
accept feature requests. However, I am happy to accept bug fixes and support for
more environments.

File a bug on the [issue tracker][] or [open a pull request][]. Please follow
the [Code of Conduct][] for all interactions. If applicable, add unit tests for
your change before sending out for review.
