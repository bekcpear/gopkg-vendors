Bus is a minimalist event/message bus implementation for internal communication.
It is heavily inspired from my [event_bus](https://github.com/otobus/event_bus)
package for Elixir language.

## API

The method names and arities/args are stable now. No change should be expected
on the package for the version `1.x.x` except any bug fixes.

## Installation

Via go packages:
```go get github.com/mustafaturan/bus```

## Usage

### Configure

The package requires a unique id generator to assign ids to events. You can
write your own function to generate unique ids or use a package that provides
unique id generation functionality.

The `bus` package respect to software design choice of the packages/projects. It
supports both singleton and dependency injection to init a `bus` instance.

*Hint:*
Check the [demo project](https://github.com/mustafaturan/bus-sample-project) for
the singleton configuration.

Here is a sample initilization using `monoton` id generator:

```go
import (
    "github.com/mustafaturan/bus"
    "github.com/mustafaturan/monoton"
    "github.com/mustafaturan/monoton/sequencer"
)

func NewBus() *bus.Bus {
    // configure id generator (it doesn't have to be monoton)
    node        := uint64(1)
    initialTime := uint64(0)
    monoton.Configure(sequencer.NewMillisecond(), node, initialTime)

    // init an id generator
    var idGenerator bus.Next = monoton.Next

    // create a new bus instance
    b, err := bus.NewBus(idGenerator)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // maybe register topics in here
    b.RegisterTopics("order.received", "order.fulfilled")

    return b
}
```

### Register Event Topics

To emit events to the topics, topic names need to be registered first:

```go
// register topics
b.RegisterTopics("order.received", "order.fulfilled")
```

### Register Event Handlers

To receive topic events you need to register handlers; A handler basically
requires two vals which are a `Handle` function and topic `Matcher` regex
pattern.

```go
handler := bus.Handler{
    Handle: func(e *bus.Event) {
        // do something
        // NOTE: Highly recommended to process the event in an async way
    },
    Matcher: ".*", // matches all topics
}
b.RegisterHandler("a unique key for the handler", &handler)
```

### Emit Events

```go
// if txID val is blank, bus package generates one using the id generator
ctx := context.Background()
ctx = context.WithValue(ctx, bus.CtxKeyTxID, "some-transaction-id-if-exists")

// event topic name (must be registered before)
topic := "order.received"

// interface{} data for event
order := make(map[string]string)
order["orderID"]     = "123456"
order["orderAmount"] = "112.20"
order["currency"]    = "USD"

// emit the event
event, err := b.Emit(ctx, topic, order)

if err != nil {
    // report the err
    fmt.Println(err)
}

// if the caller needs the event, a ref for the event is returning as result of
// the `Emit` call.
fmt.Println(event)
```

### Processing Events

When an event is emitted, the topic handlers receive the event synchronously.
It is highly recommended to process events asynchronous. Package leave the
decision to the packages/projects to use concurrency abstractions depending on
use-cases. Each handlers receive the same event as ref of `bus.Event` struct:

```go
// Event data structure
type Event struct {
	ID         string      // identifier
	TxID       string      // transaction identifier
	Topic      string      // topic name
	Data       interface{} // actual event data
	OccurredAt int64       // creation time in nanoseconds
}
```

### Sample Project

A [demo project](https://github.com/mustafaturan/bus-sample-project) with three
consumers which increments a `counter` for each event topic, `printer` consumer
which prints all events and lastly `calculator` consumer which sums amounts.
